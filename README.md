I created this ecommerce web application with the JAMstack. The fronted was built using React and Redux, Firebase was used to setup the backed and handle user authentication/storage. 

The app has the following features:
<ul>
  <li>Different pages of categories of items where users can browse through and add items to their cart.</li>
  <li>The cart is directly updated as the user adds new items. Also, from this cart, the users can navigate to the checkout page, where they can increase or decrease the quantity of added items and see the total sum.</li>
  <li>Integrated Stripe API for handling payments (Test version)</li>
</ul>
